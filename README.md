Scripts to make the plots included in a paper and the plots itself

This repository belongs to a paper submitted to Physics of Plasma. Python scripts to make the plots included in the paper as well as the figures drawn by myself are included in this repository. While the python scripts are published with an MIT license (see the files), the figures are published under an CC-BY license and are linked to a zenodo repository with a separate DOI. This ensures availability of the figures and makes it easy for anybody to re-use it (just follow the CC-BY license, see here).
